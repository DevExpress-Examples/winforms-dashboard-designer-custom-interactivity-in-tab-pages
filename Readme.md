# Dashboard for WinForms - How to use dashboard items in tab pages as independent Master Filters

This example demonstrates how to implement a custom visual interactivity that enables the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15150) dashboard items placed in different tab pages to act as independent master filters.

The example uses the following API:

* The [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemSelectionChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemSelectionChanged) event is handled to assign selected values to a [dashboard's parameter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/16135) and save them in a variable.

* The [DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemVisualInteractivity](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.DashboardItemVisualInteractivity) event is handled to restore the selected values and highlight a grid row.

* The [DashboardDesigner.CustomizeDashboardItemCaption](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.CustomizeDashboardItemCaption) event displays the filter value in the [Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/14719) item's [caption](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15620).

* The [DashboardDesigner.ConfigureDataConnection](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardDesigner.ConfigureDataConnection) event specifies the [Extract Data Source](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115900) file location at runtime.
